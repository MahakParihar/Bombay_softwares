Flask Application To Predict Nature Image Classification.

I've developed a project consisting of several key files: `.gitignore`, `app.py`, `main.py`, `model.pkl`, and 
`RandomForest.pkl`. The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories to exclude from version 
control, ensuring a clean repository. The `app.py` and `main.py` scripts form the backbone of the 
application, with `app.py` likely setting up the web server and defining routes, while `main.py` contains 
core logic and functionality. The `model.pkl` and `RandomForest.pkl` files are serialized machine learning 
models, created using Python's `pickle` module. These models are integrated into the application to 
provide predictive capabilities, showcasing a seamless blend of web development and machine learning.
Used streamlit and flask for application to predict. And for model used pre-trained models and also cnn 
and random forest and svm. Best accuracy was given by svm nd cnn.
